Release notes for Scenic 0.5.11

This release is an other unstable version in the 0.5 series. This version 
contains bugfixes and some new features for preparing the 0.6 stable series. 
This is the second release candiate for the stable version 0.6.

    Upgrading:
    *   Be sure to uninstall your previous miville or scenic before installing
        scenic.
    *   In the older source directory, use "make uninstall" as root to
        uninstall previous installations.
    *   Don't forget to run ldconfig after installation.
    *   As of 0.4.2 and later, you may want to run ./utils/install_gstreamer.sh
        again or simply apply the utils/rtpsource.diff patch to
        gst-plugins-good-0.10.17, then recompile and reinstall it. Refer to
        https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611213
        This fix adds receiver side bitrate estimation. Note that milhouse
        will function fine without it, as will scenic.
    *   Since 0.4, Scenic needs python-simplejson and gnome-themes-extras.
        Install them with aptitude. 

    Backward compatibility:
        Each release in the 0.4 series should be interoperable with each other.

    Milhouse dependency for Scenic
        Scenic always needs the same version of milhouse, eg. scenic 0.4.5
        needs milhouse 0.4.5

    Limitations:
    *   While milhouse supports many video and audio input types, Scenic only 
        supports a subset of them. 
    *   Each release version in the 0.5 branch is considered unstable and will 
        not be supported in the future. Each version is not interoperable with 
        any other version of the unstable 0.5 branch. Wait for the next release 
        in the 0.6 branch to benefit from long term support of the new features 
        of the 0.5 branch.

New features in milhouse:
    (none)

New features in scenic:
    *  #327 improve jack monitoring in scenic
    *  #552 create debian/watch file

Release notes for Scenic 0.4.2

    Milhouse:
    This minor release fixes some system-level bugs. Improvements to
    RTCP stats allow for more detailed info on rtp session quality.
    Cleaner output so that Scenic can report on errors/etc. Improvements
    to --list-cameras.

    Scenic GUI:
    Lots of improvements to the UI, include more advanced state management for both
    sessions and processes. More forwarding of info output by Milhouse (errors, rtcp, etc.)

    Documentation:
    Documentaion for installation is still accurate, but some operations (video
    and audio testing) needs to use more Scenic new features. Documentation has
    been updated to include Debian-specific instructions.  Testing on Debian
    still have to be made, especially that it doesn't come with a realtime kernel.
    Hardware support is probably different too. We'll update

Fixes:

#283: X11 display option is not working in the GUI
#284: X11 device setting is not saved in state saving
#298: Sender doesn't give the audio codec that the receiver wants.
#315: Add a window icon to milhouse

Release notes for Scenic 0.4.1

    Milhouse:
    This minor release fixes a bug with the deinterlace option. It has
    also been enabled again in the Scenic graphical user interface. We
    also fixed a bug that was preventing users to see a preview of a local
    video Web camera. An other bug has also been fixed which made the
    listing of cameras impossible on Ubuntu Karmic when the libdc1394
    library was not found. Removed globals.mak

    Scenic GUI:
    This minor release fixes a bug with the Scenic icon which was not
    showing up in the Gnome menu. It is now under
    Applications/Internet/Scenic.

    * Fixed #263 Fixed potential crash in case of wrong JSON library version.
    * Fixed #264 videoflip is frail with input material
    * Moved colorspace converter into videoflip
    * Moved application data out of the Python package.
    * Flattened gst file hierarchy
    * Videoflip (and consequently deinterlace) fixed, added extra colorspace element
    * Installation: shared librairies (except for shared_video) are installed in
    $(prefix)/lib/scenic instead of just $(prefix)/scenic
    * Fixed formatting of some i18n strings.

Release notes for Scenic 0.4

Milhouse:
This release fixes a big regression in caps transmission which broke Vorbis and Theora support in 0.3.6.
New features include better v4l2 controls, the ability to restart a sender without restarting a receiver, rtpjitterbuffer
control embedded in our output window, as well as a lot of cleanup and output fixes.

Scenic:
Moved the graphical user interface to GTK+ for faster development.
The Scenic software now polls devices using the Milhouse streamer. 
We implemented SIC, the SIP Spelled Incorrectly protocol, which mimics SIP 
to negotiate the streaming session using JSON over TCP/IP.
Moved Miville code out of trunk. 
Superseded Miville features within a three week code sprint in GTK+!
