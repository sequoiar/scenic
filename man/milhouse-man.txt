[DESCRIPTION]
milhouse is a gstreamer-based application for transmission and reception of your fine audio-visual content.

[SYNOPSIS]
milhouse [--sender|--receiver] --address address [options]
.TP
By default, milhouse uses videotestsrc as a video test source and jackaudiosrc for audio input.

[EXAMPLES]
Here is how to start a receiver and a sender to stream audio and video. 

On local_ip_address:
.TP
milhouse --receiver --address remote_ip_address --videosink xvimagesink --videocodec mpeg4 --videoport 10030 --audiosink jackaudiosink --audiocodec raw --audioport 10000

On remote_ip_address:
.TP
milhouse --sender --address local_ip_address --videocodec mpeg4 --videoport 10030  --videosource v4l2src --audiosource jackaudiosrc --audiocodec raw  -c 2 --audioport 10000

The milhouse command can also be used to change some properties of a V4L2 video device, such as the size and the video standard. The milhouse command should exit immediately once done. 

To change the video standard to either NTSC or PAL:
.TP
milhouse --v4l2-standard NTSC

To list cameras: 
.TP
milhouse --list-cameras

To choose an input for a V4L2 device:
.TP 
milhouse --v4l2-input 1
